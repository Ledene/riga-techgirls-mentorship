		<h2>Junior Front-End Developer</h2>

		<p class="sub-title">How did I get here?</p>

		<p>By a happy coincidence, earlier this summer a friend of mine sent me information on the upcoming education programme organised by Riga TechGirls. To be honest, I joined Discover Tech mainly out of curiosity. Back then, I could not picture myself in the IT field. Especially, since I did not consider myself an “IT girl”, nor did I know much about this industry. But one thing I was certain about is that I needed some major changes in life.</p>

		<p>For the past three years, I have been a self-employed translator (although I have done quite diverse professional soul-searching beforehand as well). I have enjoyed being my own boss and the flexibility that comes with freelancing, but I am desperate to find something I am really passionate about. Something that sparks joy in my eyes and keeps me energized even through long hours of studying or work. Also, being a stay-at-home translator is a rather lonely profession, and I am eager to work in a team environment with inspiring people. So, I rose to the challenge and applied for the programme.</p>

		<p class="sub-title">Why front-end?</p>

		<p>Already from the first Discover Tech session I was hooked. Each following lesson gave me hints about topics I would like to explore more. QA and UX/UI design were among the ones that caught my attention at first, so I took up some testing courses in Udemy and started to learn basics of design on Youtube. However, I quickly discovered that I am more interested in the building process rather than scrutinising a product developed by others (as it is mainly the case of QA), which directed me more towards the front-end world. I enjoy the creative problem-solving aspect as well as the interactive side of web design where there is plenty of space to think outside the box. Plus, I can imagine how this could be combined with additional UX/UI skills along the way.</p> 

		<p>Currently, I am taking a course on Coursera (HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers), using a great educational app called Mimo (which I discovered during the process and actually is a fun way to learn) and also reading materials from several other sources such as w3schools, Interneting Is Hard, etc. So far, I have familiarised myself with the basics of HTML and CSS, but I can definitely feel that I am willing and eager to learn more.</p>

		<p class="sub-title">Why am I applying for the mentorship programme?</p>

		<p>Of course, starting a totally new career (yet again) seems a bit daunting and at times I feel overwhelmed of everything that's been piling up in my to do-/read-/learn-list. But Riga TechGirls community has been such a great inspiration, and I believe having a guiding light (aka a mentor) and support during this challenging process is a key to overcoming any obstacles.</p>

		<p>So, I would like to conclude this rather extended version of application with a deep gratitude to all the creators and contributors of Riga TechGirls for the immense encouragement and motivational boost, and I would truly appreciate the opportunity to continue this journey together with you by being a part of this year’s mentorship programme.</p>
